# ScyllaHide

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0ia5b6ln4twwqwjm?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/x64dbg/scyllahide)

ScyllaHide is an advanced open-source x64/x86 user mode Anti-Anti-Debug library. It hooks various functions to hide debugging. This tool is intended to stay in user mode (ring 3). If you need kernel mode (ring 0) Anti-Anti-Debug, please see [TitanHide](https://github.com/mrexodia/titanhide). Forked from [NtQuery/ScyllaHide](https://bitbucket.org/NtQuery/scyllahide).

ScyllaHide supports various debuggers through plugins:

- OllyDbg [v1](http://www.ollydbg.de) and [v2](http://www.ollydbg.de/version2.html)
- [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com)
- [Hex-Rays IDA 7.5+](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) (x86 is not supported)
- TitanEngine v2 ([original](http://www.reversinglabs.com/open-source/titanengine.html) and [updated](https://github.com/x64dbg/TitanEngine/) versions)

PE x64 debugging is fully supported with plugins for x64dbg and IDA.

Please note that ScyllaHide is not limited to these debuggers. You can use the standalone command line version of ScyllaHide. You can inject ScyllaHide into any process debugged by any debugger.
