ScyllaHide is an advanced open-source x64/x86 usermode Anti-Anti-Debug library. It hooks various functions in usermode to hide debugging. This tool is intended to stay in usermode (ring3). If you need kernelmode (ring0) Anti-Anti-Debug please see TitanHide https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/titanhide.

ScyllaHide supports various debuggers with plugins:

- OllyDbg v1 and v2 http://www.ollydbg.de
- x64_dbg http://x64dbg.com or https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/x64_dbg
- Hex-Rays IDA v6+ https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/
- TitanEngine v2 https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/titanengine-update and http://www.reversinglabs.com/open-source/titanengine.html

PE x64 debugging is fully supported with plugins for x64_dbg and IDA.

Please note: ScyllaHide is not limited to these debuggers. You can use the standalone commandline version of ScyllaHide. You can inject ScyllaHide in any process debugged by any debugger.
